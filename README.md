# Developing a hook
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css" />
This first step is *exploratory.* You have to let yourself be free! Don't overthink your answers, just jot things down. Yes, really jot! Grab a scrap paper and pen, or open a notepad on your computer, and make some notes to the following questions. You can do bullet points, word clouds, phrases, or compete sentences. Up to you! BE FREE!
> This short video about writing hooks is **not** specifically about grant proposals, but the principles apply. Check it out!

### Questions to answer
* What are you passionate about, in terms of research?

* What is the problem or need, and why is it important?

* What sources of kinds of data can you use to validate the importance of your proposed project?

* How is existing knowledge or practice inadequate?

* Why is your idea better?

* How is it new, unique, different?

* What will it contribute, and who will benefit from it (intellectual merit and broader impacts?

* What is the goal of your proposal (make sure you have a clear goal statement)?

* What is a specific, measureable objective for your proposal?

# Flow of logic
The body of your proposal should follow a logical path and address the following points, as described in *The Grant Application Writer's Workbook: National Science Foundation - FastLane Version, Part Two, Chapter 7 Online: Create a Bullet Outline for your Overview and Obectives Section,* freely available for download [here:](http://www.grantcentral.com/downloads-nsf/)

**<center>LINEAR PROGRESSION OF LOGIC FOR A STRONG OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVES SECTION</center>**

![From The Grant Application Writer's Workbook: National Science Foundation - FastLane Version, Chapter 7 Online: Create a Bulleted Outline for your Overview and Objectives Section.](images/logic.png)
*From The Grant Application Writer's Workbook: National Science Foundation - FastLane Version, Chapter 7 Online: Create a Bullet Outline for your Overview and Objectives Section.*

### Introductory paragraph
* Opening sentence
  * should be arresting; remember your hook!
  * relevant to the program you're applying to 
  * establish that it's an important topic (avoid truisms)

* Current knowledge
  * 2-3 sentences total
  * inform reviewers of current state of knowledge, but know your audience!
  * present oldest → newest
  * establish yourself as expert

* Gap in knowledge
  * point out that this next step is needed to advance the field 
  * establish that this is an important problem and it being unknown is blocking progress
  * must be simple, direct and must relate to the preceding current knowledge
  * all of the logic downstream will evolve from this gap


### “What, why, who”

* Long-term goal
  * continuum of research 

* Overall objective
  * what will be accomplished 
  * links back to gap in knowledge

* Central hypothesis
  * the hypothesis that must be tested to to attain your overall objective
  * set up presentaion of your specific aims
  * also include here any preliminary data that support the central hypothesis, if you have any
  
* Rationale
  * link back to gap, but put a positive spin on the "problem" statement. What happens if the gap is filled?
    * "once X is identified, Y can happen,” where Y is something of interest to your audience
  
### Specific aims
* lay out that you will test parts of your central hypothesis, *or*
* lay out tasks that will be undertaken to meet the need/fill the gap

### "Payoff" paragraph
* creativity, originality, and/or transformative potential
* expected outcomes
* positive impact on field

#### Exercise
1. Complete *The Grant Application Writer's Workbook: National Science Foundation - FastLane Version, Part Two, Chapter 7 Online: Create a Bulleted Outline for your Overview and Obectives Section,* downloadable from [here,](http://www.grantcentral.com/downloads-nsf/) to create a bulleted outline of your proposal.
2. Continue developing your "hook" and bulleted outline into a 1-2 paragraph description of your topic. This should encompass the gap through to central hypothesis as described above and in the suggested reading. Focus on the clarity of ideas rather than elegant text, and remember: Keep it Simple! 
3. Find a friend to review your hook or review your own using [this rubric.](files/Hook_rubric.pdf)

# Literature searching

Effective literature searching involves identifying the appropriate breadth and depth of a literature review, as well as knowing where to find appropriate sources. 

> This short video lays out a nice introduction on how to write a literature review. Even if you've written literature reviews before, it might be worth it to review the basics to get you going on the right track. Plus, the video links to several other helpful videos on the topic. 
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="zIYC6zG265E" %}

### Annotated bibliography
It's in your benefit to create a simple, annotated bibliography to work from for your proposal. It doesn't have to be anything too fancy, just a way to have all your references organized with the major or relevant findings summarized for ease of use. 
For a good example, see [this sample annotated bibliography](https://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Buckley2014_OxBib.pdf) by [Lauren Buckley](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/lauren-buckley), professor at University of Washington. 


#### Exercise
1. Write a series of questions/sub-headings addressing each aspect of your central hypothesis. 
	* Perform a literature search, and identify the most influential papers that address that question/topic.  
	* Write a short summary of each paper addressing the topic, method of analysis, conclusions, and how it relates to your question/topic. 
	* You should aim for a total of 15-20 papers max, so you will have to be selective about which are the KEY papers that your work is in conversation with. 
	* Aim to include a mix of classic and recent papers. 
	* Show this annotated bibliography to your mentor and PI to get suggestions for any papers you may have missed.

# Developing a plan
If you've already done the section **Constructing a flow of logic**, this section will build off of that. Here is where we will fully flesh out the plan of your proposal. 

### Introduction 
The introduction is the conceptual overview of the **aim**. In this section you'll want to **hook** the reader and explain why the **aim** is worthwhile. 
  * Give a brief summary 
  * Lay out the justification of the approach
  * Think of the overall outcome in the **aim**

### Research design
The research design is really *"how you will do it."* You'll want to arrange the **aims** in a logical flow but make sure the aims are not dependent on each other's outcomes to be successful. This section is about *experimental design* more than it is about *methodology.* Don't focus on detailed  methods of equipment and reagents, but rather discuss broad techniques and how what they will produce. 
Be sure to include the following in your design, where applicable:
  * Replication
  * Randomization 
  * Controls (most important)
 	 * Positive vs. negative
  * Limitations of technology 
  * Limitations of technique 

When writing your experimental design: How do you know what level of detail is appropriate? Consider the following: 
  * Is it citable?
  * Does it fit the space?
  * What is the analysis framework?
  * Are critical reagents difficult to retain?
  * What is the timeline of the project?
  * What are the sampling points?

### Expected outcomes 
  * Show you understand what type of data
  * Potential problems/alternative approaches 
  * Demonstrate expertise and head off any reviewer concerns 
  * Will this be a common concern 
  * Alterative strategy 

> **Tip:** Throughout your design writing, be sure to use strong language. For example, instead of stating that you "*hope*" or will "*try*" to achieve something, state that you **will!** You can also convey confidence by highlighting resources on campus that make you the ideal researcher for this project. 

### Hypothesis
Forming a hypothesis may sound simple, but it can be challenging to do! Here are some characteristics of a *great* hypothesis:

* Rooted in existing knowledge 
* Simple/straight-forward
* General, but generates new streams of ideas (is going to be interesting in 10 years?)
* Testable with a clear alternative hypothesis
* Falsifiable 
	* Can be clearly refuted 

#### Exercise 
1. Fill out your *Aims* in the general format below: 
* Aim 1: Title
  * Introduction
  * Research Design
  * Expected Outcomes
  * Potential problem and alternate approaches

# Figures and tables
Figures and tables are essential parts of scientific papers and can be extremely useful in proposals, too. Your proposal reviewer must be able to understand and interpret your proposal to select it for funding, and displays should be included with that goal in mind. Here are some purposes of displays, summarized: 
  * Give information in reduced space
  * Give information more clearly
  * Provide compelling preliminary data
  * Provide proof of feasibility
  * Stick in reviewer’s mind
  * Provide visual break for reviewer (*anectodally, this one seems to be important!*)
  * Make proposal visually attractive

### Types of displays
You may not know what displays you should include, just yet. Below are some types of displays to get you thinking:
  * Conceptual – illustrate concept or hypothesis, pose predictions graphically
  * Summarize – present information in concise format
  * Data – present preliminary results
  * Experimental design – Explain experimental design/ methods

### Better figures
Figure design is not just about aesthetics. A well-designed, and intentionally-designed, will not only reduce distractions but will help the figure *do its job*. Here are some tips from [Rougier et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833).
  * Know your audience
  * Identify your message
  * Adapt the figure to the support medium (i.e. consider size and complexity)
  * Captions are not optional
  * Use color effectively
  * Avoid “chartjunk”
  * Must be fully legible when printed in black and white (9 pt Arial font or above)

> Kelly Krause, Creative Director at the publishing group *Nature*, gave this short presentation on The Basics of Information Design for Scientific Figures.
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="Lb4uG4rIwPA" %}
<br>
Okay, so you've got good figures now. How do you work them into the text? Here are some tips:
  * When do you want the reader to look at the display? Position the display as close to the corresponding text as possible. 
  * Explicitly send your readers to look at the display. E.g. “As can be seen from Fig. 3, …”
  * In the text, focus on the conclusions or the "big picture" that you want them to conclude from the display. Then, give the details of the display in the display's title or caption. 
  * If your display is preliminary data, state why these data are important for specific **aim**. 
  
Figure legends are just as important as the figure itself. Be sure your figure and legend includes:
* Brief title for figure
* Description of main point/result of figure
* Methods required to interpret figure including sample sizes
* Key for any symbols/abbreviations


#### Exercise
1. Read [Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures by Rougier et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833)
2. Finish a complete draft of your research proposal.

# Scientific writing 
The goal of scientific writing is to say precisely what you want to say as clearly and as simply as possible. 
> “Write unto others as you would they write unto you”

### Writing as craft
The purpose of writing a proposal, in particular, is to persuade. You must take the reader by the hand from *what they already know* to *what you want them to know.* To be most effective, you will want to write with **clarity** and **style,** but it takes practice!
> “Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can, That is the only secret of style”
-Matthew Arnold

If you've been following along with the *Exercises* in this guide, you've already written a complete draft. Congratulations! Especially if it was your first time writing on this subject, it might have been painful. But don't let it be: the first draft of an idea WILL be badly written! Rejoice in producing crappy prose.
As you revise it, you will make it clearer, and in the process will understand the ideas better yourself. 
The first step is always to organize your ideas to the extent that is currently possible, then start drafting. Importantly, separate drafting from editing. It can be very tempting to write and re-write a setence over and over, essentially flipping back and forth between drafting and editing, without getting any farther along in your draft. Don't do that! Remember these words: "Write when you write, edit when you edit."

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="G5UGU9MV7Z0" %}

> K.I.S.S., Keep It Simple, Students!

Much of scientific writing is needlessly complex and obscures, rather than illuminates, the meaning. Consider the following sentence: 
* “An understanding of the causal factors involved in excessive drinking by students could lead to their more effective treatment.” 
* “We could more effectively treat students who drink excessively if we understand why they do.”

Which version is clearer? Likely, you picked the second version. Think about the differences between the two versions and just what exactly makes the second clearer than the first. 

### Ten principles
Here we present *ten principles* of writing clearly. Study them, review them, internalize them, and soon they'll become second-nature when writing.
1. Distinguish real grammatical rules from folklore
2. Use subjects to name characters in your story
3. Use verbs to name important actions
4. Open your sentences with familiar information
5. Get to the main verb quickly
6. Push new, complex information to the end of the sentence
7. Begin sentences constituting a paragraph with consistent topics/subjects
8. Be concise
9. Control sprawl
10. Above all, *write to others as you would have others write to you*. 

### Sentences as stories
You might have noticed the two sample sentences above differed in the order of the sentence. The first went *"understanding" > "treatment,"* and the second was *"treat" > "understand."* Why does the order make such a difference? This is partly principle 2 above: use subjects to name characters in your story. A treatment does not simply exist: a person or a group does the treating--"we could more effectively treat..." Likewise, an understanding does not exist without a person to understand it. Use subjects and verbs intentionally.

Try re-writing the following sentence:
* “Once upon a time, as a walk through the woods was taking place on the part of Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf’s jump out from behind a tree occurred, causing her fright.” 


The sentence structure above may come across as silly when it's used in a familiar story with characters and actions we know of. Yet, this structure can blend in better--and does, entirely too often--within scientific writing. However, this structure does *not* increase clarity! In fact, it hinders it. 

So how do we prevent it? The answer is simple: use subjects and verbs more intentionally. Remember the basic sentence structure of subject + verb and, sometimes, the object of the verb.
<br>
**Subject       >       Verb       >       Object**	

Main characters should be the subjects of the verbs. In the Red Riding Hood example, the subjects are "walk" and "jump," both of these verbs being used as nouns. My oh my, how very confusing, that is!
* "Once upon a time, as a **walk** through the woods was taking place on the part of Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf’s **jump** out from behind a tree occurred, causing her fright."

Your re-write of the sentence may have been something like this:
* "Once upon a time, **Little Red Riding Hood** was walking through the woods, when **the Wolf** jumped out from behind a tree and frightened her."

This is a great improvement in clarity and style. The subjects are now appropriately the characters "Little Red Riding Hood" and "the Wolf" and they are the ones doing the actions (verbs). 

The phenomenon in the first version of the Little Red Riding Hood sentence is "nominalization." This refers to nouns that are created from verbs or adjectives. In general, it is best to avoid nominalizations and use the verbs, instead. 
| Noun | Verb |
| ---- | ---- |
| Intention | Intend |
| Intervention | Intervene |
| Distortion | Distort |
| Evolution | Evolve |
| Interference | Interfere | 
| Discrimination | Discriminate |
| Decision | Decide |
| Assumption | Assume |
| Collection | Collect |
| Investigation | Investigate |
| Expansion | Expand |
| Disagreement | Disagree |
| Discussion | Discuss |
| Argument | Argue |
| Failure | Fail |  

* “The outsourcing of a high-tech work to Asia by corporation results in the loss of many jobs for American workers”
	* Underline nouns
	* Find main characters
	* Look for actions they perform
	* Rewrite nominalizations as verbs
	* Rewrite using subordinating conjunctions (because, when, although, why, how, whether, that) 

#### Noun strings
Noun strings are exactly what they sound like: strings of nouns in a row in a sentence! It is easy to get lost in a noun string and you never want the reader to be lost in your proposal. Here's an example:
* Early childhood thought disorder misdiagnosis often results from...
While that string of nouns might technically be correct, it lacks in *clarity* and *style.* To correct it, add a character, reverse the order of the words, and find prepositions to connect them. For example:
| (Character) | early | childhood | thought | disorder| misdiagnosis |
| ------------ | ---- | ---------| --------- | ------ | ------------ |
| (Physicians) | misdiagnose | disordered | thought | in early | childhood |


### Cohesion
Cohesive writing is characterized by the last words of one sentence appearing at the beginning of the next sentence. This is part of what makes a piece have good "flow." Yet, if every sentence is beginning with the subject, how can we also end with the subject? In reality, your writing has to balance clarity with cohesion for a nice flow. You will want to begin sentences with familiar information and end with information that is new or that otherwise the reader cannot anticipate. You may have to use passive, rather than active, voice to achieve cohesion. 

* Cohesion is the way the sentences add up to the whole picture
* Consistent ideas towards beginning of sentences, coherent subjects
* Paragraphs focus on a narrow set of related ideas
* Don’t use “throat clearing” – starting sentences with lots of qualifiers
* Use the end of your sentences to communicate long complex phrases, new information, and technical terms


##### Exercise
1. Read [The Science of Scientific Writing](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/gopen_and_swan_science_of_scientific_writing.pdf) by George D. Gopen and Judith A. Swan.
2. Edit your draft for increased clarity.
	* Send your draft to your reviewers for feedback! Be sure to tell your reviewers what you'd like feedback on, in particular, if anything. 
	* If you're reviewing someone else's writing, focus on cohesion or coherence as of the writing sample as a whole, but focus on one sentence to edit and improve clarity.

# Eye-catching titles
The tile of the proposal should be brief, scientiiccally valid, intelligible for the audience, and potentially suitable for use in a public format as often times awarded proposal titles are lsited on websites, for example. 

> **Tip:** Your title should emphasize the payoff---the *product* of the research.
