# Developing a hook
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="MvjeLUuITlQ" %}
This first step is *exploratory.* You have to let yourself be free! Don't overthink your answers, just jot things down. Yes, really jot! Grab a scrap paper and pen, or open a notepad on your computer, and make some notes to the following questions. You can do bullet points, word clouds, phrases, or compete sentences. Up to you! BE FREE!

## Questions to answer
* What are you passionate about, in terms of research?

* What is the problem or need, and why is it important?

* What sources of kinds of data can you use to validate the importance of your proposed project?

* How is existing knowledge or practice inadequate?

* Why is your idea better?

* How is it new, unique, different?

* What will it contribute, and who will benefit from it (intellectual merit and broader impacts?

* What is the goal of your proposal (make sure you have a clear goal statement)?

* What is a specific, measureable objective for your proposal?

# Constructing a linear flow of logic
## Gap in knowledge
## Objectives
## Hypotheses
## Specific aims

***
# Effective literature searching

Identifying the appropriate breadth and depth of a literature review, as well as where to find appropriate sources

## Exercise
Write a series of questions/sub-headings addressing each aspect of your central hypothesis. Perform a literature search, and identify the most influential papers that address that question/topic.  Write a short summary of each paper addressing the topic, method of analysis, conclusions, and how it relates to your question/topic. You should aim for a total of 15-20 papers max, so you will have to be selective about which are the KEY papers that your work is in conversation with. Aim to include a mix of classic and recent papers. Show this annotated bibliography to your mentor and PI to get suggestions for any papers you may have missed.

# Developing a research plan


Introduction 
“This is the conceptual overview of the aim”
Want to hook the reader and explain why this aim is worthwhile
Give a brief summary 
Justification of approach
Think of overall outcome in Aim

Research Design (How you will do it)
Arrange the Aims in a logical flow
Make sure the aims (especially their outcome) aren’t dependent on other aims to be successful 
Experimental design vs. methodology 
Won’t be detailed methods of equipment and reagents 
Replication
Randomization 
Controls (most important)
Positive vs negative
Limitations of technology 
Limitations of technique 
Look in the literature 
When writing your experimental design: How do you know what level of detail is appropriate (is it citable)
Citable 
Fits space 
Analysis framework 
Critical reagents difficult to retain 
Timeline
Sampling points

Expected outcomes 
Show you understand what type of data
Potential problems/alternative approaches 
Demonstrate expertise and head off any reviewer concerns 
Will this be a common concern 
Alterative strategy 



Use strong language:
hope , try ---> we will
Ask yourself is their sufficient detail in my hands … conceptional aspects of the aim 
highlight resources on campus that make you the ideal researcher

Characteristics of a great hypothesis 
Testable
Falsifiable 
Can be clearly refuted 
General 
Also, generate new streams of ideas (is going to be interesting in 10 years)
Rooted in existing knowledge 
Thought about the alternative hypothesis 
Simple/straight forwarded

## Exercise 
Fill out the Aims in the general format below: 
Aim 1: Title
Introduction
Research Design
Expected Outcomes
Potential problem and alternate approaches

# Effective use of figures and displays


Purposes of displays:
Give information in reduced space
Give information more clearly
Provide compelling preliminary data
Provide proof of feasibility
Stick in reviewer’s mind
Provide visual break for reviewer
Make proposal visually attractive
Types of displays:
Conceptual – illustrate concept or hypothesis, pose predictions graphically
Summarize – present information in concise format
Data – present preliminary results
Experimental design – Explain experimental design/ methods
Rules for better figures (from Rougier et al. 2014)
Know your audience
Identify your message
Adapt the figure to the support medium (i.e. consider size and complexity)
Captions are not optional
Use color effectively
Avoid “chartjunk”
Must be fully legible when printed in black and white (9 pt Arial font or above)
Integrating displays into text
When do you want the reader to look at the display? Position as close as possible. 
Explicitly send them to look at the display. E.g. “As can be seen from Fig. 3, …”
Conclusions/ big picture stuff in text, tell reader what you want them to conclude from the display. Give details in display title or caption. 
Preliminary data - state why these data are important for specific aim. 
Components of figure legends 
Brief title for figure
Description of main point/result of figure
Methods required to interpret figure including sample sizes
Key for any symbols/abbreviations

# The art of scientific writing 

Based on Style: Lesson in Clarity and Grace by Joseph Williams  

Know what you want to say: as clearly and simply as possible 
Exercise :
Undertanding causal factors … lead to more effective treatment 
Treatments that address excessive drinnking 
We could more effectively treat students who drink excessively if we underant why they do 
[subject] [verb] [object]
Ten Principles for Writing Clearly
Example 2:
Subject: The wolf’s jump (a walk through the woods)
Verb: occurred
Object: Little Red Riding Hood
Once upon a time, Little Red 
Nominalizations: when you turn a verb into a noun
You see this all the time in scientific writing 
Example 3:
“The outsourcing of a high-tech work to Asia by corporation results in the loss of many jobs for American workers”
Nominalizations: “the outsourcing of”
“American workers lose jobs when high-tech jobs are outsourced to Asia”
Bad: The intention of the committee is to improve morale
Good: The committee intends to improve morale 
Think about characters
Noun strings:
Early childhood thought disorder misdiagnosis often result from
Physicians misdiagnose disorders in early childhood
Cohesion and coherence 


***
# Broader impacts

***
# Personal statements 

***
# Creating an eye-catching title
The tile of the proposal should be brief, scientiiccally valid, intelligible for the audience, and potentially suitable for use in a public format as often times awarded proposal titles are lsited on websites, for example. 

## Tip
Your title should emphasize the payoff---the *product* of the research.
