# Developing a research idea

This first step is *exploratory.* You have to let yourself be free! Don't overthink your answers, just jot things down. Yes, really jot! Grab a scrap paper and pen, or open a notepad on your computer, and make some notes to the following questions. You can do bullet points, word clouds, phrases, or compete sentences. Up to you! BE FREE!

## Some questions you may want to answer in your “hook”


```
What are you passionate about, in terms of research?

What is the problem or need, and why is it important?

What sources of kinds of data can you use to validate the importance of your proposed project?

How is existing knowledge or practice inadequate?

Why is your idea better?

How is it new, unique, different?

What will it contribute, and who will benefit from it (intellectual merit and broader impacts?

What is the goal of your proposal (make sure you have a clear goal statement)?

What is a specific, measureable objective for your proposal?
