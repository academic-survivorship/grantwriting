# Developing a research idea

This first step is *exploratory.* You have to let yourself be free! Don't overthink your answers, just jot things down. Yes, really jot! Grab a scrap paper and pen, or open a notepad on your computer, and make some notes to the following questions. You can do bullet points, word clouds, phrases, or compete sentences. Up to you! BE FREE!

## Some questions you may want to answer in your “hook”


```
What are you passionate about, in terms of research?

What is the problem or need, and why is it important?

What sources of kinds of data can you use to validate the importance of your proposed project?

How is existing knowledge or practice inadequate?

Why is your idea better?

How is it new, unique, different?

What will it contribute, and who will benefit from it (intellectual merit and broader impacts?

What is the goal of your proposal (make sure you have a clear goal statement)?

What is a specific, measureable objective for your proposal?
```

# Constructing a linear flow of logic
## Gap in knowledge
## Objectives
## Hypotheses
## Specific aims


# Effective literature searching

Identifying the appropriate breadth and depth of a literature review, as well as where to find appropriate sources

## Exercise
Write a series of questions/sub-headings addressing each aspect of your central hypothesis. Perform a literature search, and identify the most influential papers that address that question/topic.  Write a short summary of each paper addressing the topic, method of analysis, conclusions, and how it relates to your question/topic. You should aim for a total of 15-20 papers max, so you will have to be selective about which are the KEY papers that your work is in conversation with. Aim to include a mix of classic and recent papers. Show this annotated bibliography to your mentor and PI to get suggestions for any papers you may have missed. 

# Developing a research plan


Introduction 
“This is the conceptual overview of the aim”
Want to hook the reader and explain why this aim is worthwhile
Give a brief summary 
Justification of approach
Think of overall outcome in Aim

Research Design (How you will do it)
Arrange the Aims in a logical flow
Make sure the aims (especially their outcome) aren’t dependent on other aims to be successful 
Experimental design vs. methodology 
Won’t be detailed methods of equipment and reagents 
Replication
Randomization 
Controls (most important)
Positive vs negative
Limitations of technology 
Limitations of technique 
Look in the literature 
When writing your experimental design: How do you know what level of detail is appropriate (is it citable)
Citable 
Fits space 
Analysis framework 
Critical reagents difficult to retain 
Timeline
Sampling points

Expected outcomes 
Show you understand what type of data
Potential problems/alternative approaches 
Demonstrate expertise and head off any reviewer concerns 
Will this be a common concern 
Alterative strategy 



Use strong language:
hope , try ---> we will
Ask yourself is their sufficient detail in my hands … conceptional aspects of the aim 
highlight resources on campus that make you the ideal researcher

Characteristics of a great hypothesis 
Testable
Falsifiable 
Can be clearly refuted 
General 
Also, generate new streams of ideas (is going to be interesting in 10 years)
Rooted in existing knowledge 
Thought about the alternative hypothesis 
Simple/straight forwarded

## Activity 
Fill out the Aims in the general format below: 
Aim 1: Title
Introduction
Research Design
Expected Outcomes
Potential problem and alternate approaches
